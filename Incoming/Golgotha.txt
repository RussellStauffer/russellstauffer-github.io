Let's Go to Golgotha

Summary:

Time-travelling tourists go on a "Crucifixion Tour." The tour operator 
warns the tourists that they must not do anything to disrupt history: 
specifically, when the crowd is asked whether to spare Jesus or 
Barabbas, the tourists must all join the call "Give us Barabbas!" (a 
priest absolves them from any guilt for so doing). However, when the 
moment comes, the protagonist suddenly realizes that the crowd 
condemning Jesus to the cross is composed entirely of tourists from the
 future, and that no actual Jewish Jerusalemites of 33 AD are present 
 at all.
