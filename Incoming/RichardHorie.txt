Richard Horie

Biography

Richard Horie has worked in almost every field as a comics creator, 
from writer and penciller to inker and colorist, the latter of which he
(with wife Tanya) is perhaps now best known. Richard, according to The 
Best author Heidi MacDonald once worked for Disney in some capacity, 
but his first known comics credits appear in the mid-1990s for Image 
Comics. In October 1992, he wrote and pencilled part of Brigade #2, 
alongside writers Hank Kanalz and Eric Stephenson, writer/artist Rob
Liefeld and penciller Marat Mychaels. He penciled and inked for 
Stephenson several times over the next year, on titles including 
Supreme, various Youngblood titles, Brigade, Bloodstrike and Deathmate.
He provided inks for an issue of Jim Valentino's ShadowHawk, and was 
one of several writers and artists to contribute to the "Extreme" 
preview created for Hero Illustrated magazine, touting Liefeld's Image
imprint Extreme Studios.[3] Richard's work for Extreme continued along 
similar lines to his earlier image work, pencilling issues of 
Bloodstrike, Brigade, Chapel, Prophet and Operation Knightstrike amongst
others.
